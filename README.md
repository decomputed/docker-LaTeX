# docker-LaTeX
This repo contains a docker file for a running LaTeX instalation, in case you don't want to install LaTeX yourself.

As of now, the image produced is very big (~2gb) since it's not possible to know ahead of time what users will need from the TeXLive distribution. 

Still, this is based on the medium distro, rather than the large, and it's based on a base Arch Linux distro, which is also quite small.
